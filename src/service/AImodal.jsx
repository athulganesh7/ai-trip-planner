Prices can fluctuate dramatically based on the time of year, day of the week, and availability.  *Always* check current prices on booking sites before committing.  Circus Circus is often the absolute cheapest, but the Stratosphere and Excalibur are also good options.  Prices provided are estimates.\n\n*   **Transportation:** Public transportation (The Deuce bus) is emphasized as the cheapest option. Rideshares are faster but add up quickly. Walking is great for short distances on the Strip.\n\n*   **Food:** Saving money on food is essential. The itinerary suggests affordable options like happy hours, food courts, and bringing your own snacks.\n\n*   **Free Activities:** The focus is on free attractions: the Bellagio fountains, Fremont Street Experience, window shopping, etc.\n\n*   **Optional Activities:** Activities like the High Roller, SlotZilla, and Mob Museum are mentioned, but marked as optional.  Factor them into your budget only if you have room.\n\n*   **Flexibility:** This is just a suggested itinerary. Feel free to swap things around based on your interests.\n\n*   **Safety:** Las Vegas is generally safe, but be aware of your surroundings, especially at night and in crowded areas.\n\n*   **Booking:** Book hotels and any optional paid activities in advance, especially if traveling during a peak season.\n\n*   **Website Checks:** Always double-check the official websites for attractions and restaurants for their most up-to-date hours, pricing, and any COVID-related restrictions.\n\n*   **Hydration:**  It's hot in Las Vegas, especially in the summer. Drink plenty of water.\n\nThis JSON provides a structured and detailed plan to help a couple enjoy a memorable Las Vegas trip on a shoestring budget! Good luck and have a great time!\n"},
